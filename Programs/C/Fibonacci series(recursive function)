/*
    You are to write a C program that accepts two (2) non-negative integers: 
	let the first integer, n, be the nth element of the series (the start element of the output), 
	and the second input be the number of elements to be printed from the nth element.

/*
	This Programs bit like this i have 3 variables are first next second
	first = 0, next = 0, second = 1
	
	formula I used this following:
	first = first + second;
	second = next;
	next = first;
	
	So what happen is like this
	1st run = first = 0, second = 1, next = 0
	2nd run = first = 1, second = 0, next = 1
	3nd run = first = 1, second = 1, next = 1
	4nd run = first = 2, second = 1, next = 2
	5nd run = first = 3, second = 2, next = 3
	6nd run = first = 5, second = 3 next = 5
	7nd run = first = 8, second 5, next = 8
	
	And then print variable next and you get: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8
